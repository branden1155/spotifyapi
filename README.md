# Project Overview

This is the week 1 Project Overview. (1/8/2023)

This is my Spotify API application Project. The overall goal for this project is to allow users to browse the search bar once authorized via Sign-in. Once the user is validated via JSON web AUTH tokens. The user then can search throughout Spotifys song list using Spotifys web-api ([Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)). This search can be done via Artists, Songs, and Albumns.

# Prerequisites

- NodeJS = v18.12.0
- NPM = v8.2.0
- Dotenv =  v16.0.3
- Express = v4.18.2
- Nodemon = v2.0.20

 All test were done using Postman

# Getting Started

To get Started, start off by running >= npm i
This will initialize the dependencies needed to run the application.

(if using Localhost PORTs)
Make sure there are no other servers running on PORTs 3001, and also 3002 for backups. (If there are other servers running on these ports, the applications server will not start.)

To start the applcations server, run >= npm start
The server will automatically stay updated using Nodemon when changes are made.
